12.15.2021 - Geometry.h created, pushed to main - a header file featuring the polymorphic framework for N-vectors. 
Implemented using the structures, but not classes because there's no need to complicate the code as of now. At this stage, 
templates provide enough flexibility. Namely, just two lines introducing vec3 and vec4 via name mangling (typedef) allow 
not to rewrite same code twice for vec3 and vec4 respectively.
